The sum_sq() function is designed to compute the sum of the squares of two user-provided integers efficiently. It begins by prompting the user for input and then calculates the square of each integer before summing the results. Initially, the implementation uses the pow() function from <math.h> to perform exponentiation, but this approach introduces unnecessary floating-point calculations, which can lead to inefficiencies. The function is structured as follows:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include "sum_sq.h"

void sum_sq() {
   int x, y;
   printf("Enter two integers: ");
   scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);

   int x_squared = pow(x, 2);
   int y_squared = pow(y, 2);

   int sum_of_squares = x_squared + y_squared;
   printf("The sum of the squares of %d and %d is: %d\n", x, y, sum_of_squares);
}
While functionally correct, this implementation can be optimized. The use of pow(x, 2) is redundant when working with integers, as exponentiation in floating-point arithmetic is unnecessary for simple squaring operations. Instead, replacing pow(x, 2) with x * x significantly improves efficiency by eliminating floating-point operations and maintaining integer precision. The revised version of the function is as follows:

void sum_sq() {
   int x, y;
   printf("Enter two integers: ");
   scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);

   int x_squared = x * x;  // Optimized integer squaring
   int y_squared = y * y;

   int sum_of_squares = x_squared + y_squared;
   printf("The sum of the squares of %d and %d is: %d\n", x, y, sum_of_squares);
}
This updated version ensures that the function remains both computationally efficient and precise. By removing unnecessary floating-point operations, it improves performance, particularly in environments where efficiency is a priority. This optimization is a small but effective example of how algorithmic improvements can enhance computational efficiency in real-world applications.
